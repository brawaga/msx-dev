These are some libs I use or will use in the development.
Pull requests with amendments are appreciated, and surely I will glad to see these in assembly since I consider they are very likely performance critical.

# Building
All libs are supplied with make.bat file that builds it, install.bat that installs it, and uninst.bat that uninstalls it.
