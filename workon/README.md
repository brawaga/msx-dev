Copies header and library files to ramdisk, from directory given and directories mentioned in project.cfg of that directory.
That is useful because of faster compilation and also no way to say compliler there are several directories to look for headers.
Usage:
```
WORKON <dir>
```
Use COMMIT command to store current state of work, or ENDWORK to do the same but also remove ramdisk.
